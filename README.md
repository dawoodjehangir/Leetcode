# Leetcode

## most common patterns:

hash maps for lookups,
binary search for ordered data,
two pointers for array manipulation,
BFS and DFS for tree or graph traversal, and
dynamic programming for optimization problems.

## Data Structures

### Objects

- works for us when we don't need ordering of data within
- how it works is explained by hashing and hash maps
- $$O(1)$$: insertion, access, removal
- $$O(N)$$: searching

#### methods

- $$O(N)$$: Object.keys
- $$O(N)$$: Object.values
- $$O(N)$$: Object.entries
  This is a little more work as it gives both the Key-Value pair
- $$O(1)$$: hasOwnProperty
  To check if a Key exists in the object
